When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to keep my work safe in an cloud and for online collaborating. Also, to modify or create new files online, if I do not have my computer near to me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because sometimes it can not be a logical change in the code and some errors can occur if part of the code is not putting complete in the remote repository.
