- When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to keep my work safe in an cloud and for online collaborating. Also, to modify or create new files online, if I do not have my computer near to me.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because sometimes it can not be a logical change in the code and some errors can occur if part of the code is not putting complete in the remote repository.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a repository online in Github, that remains a link to the original repository without modifying it. I can use it when I do not have access to modifying a repository directly, so I can copy it directly on Github an can apply my refactory code without modifying the original.

A clone is a copy of a repository from Github to my local machine or from my local machine to another directory of my local machine. I can use it when I want to copy my online repository to my local machine to modify it, or when I want to copy the repository to another location on my computer without making a branch and without damaged the original.

A branch is a new modified version of my work with a new feature or for experiments to the code. I can use this when I want to improve the work or add a new feature and in the future I can easy add it to the original work using merge command.
